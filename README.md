# Gesture Recognition

Hand gesture recognition using Google's MediaPipe library can be leveraged to create a virtual mouse and virtual screen, enhancing human-computer interaction by enabling users to control devices with intuitive hand movements. Moreover, this technology extends its utility beyond conventional computing interfaces to make robots smarter by allowing them to react to diverse gestures in distinct ways. With accurate gesture interpretation, robots can perform specific actions based on recognized hand signals, contributing to more responsive and interactive robotic systems.
